Download the genesis file and address book
Genesis file specifies the account balances and parameters at the start of the network to use when replaying transactions and syncing.

Addressbook lists a selection of peers for your node to dial to in order to discover other nodes in the network. The current testnet information is as follows:

Network: 35-C
Genesis: TODO
AddressBook: TODO
Seed nodes: TODO
For default dymd configurations, the genesis and addressbook files should be placed under ~/.dymension/config/genesis.json and ~/.dymension/config/addrbook.json respectively.

Continue to the Sync page to find out more about syncing your node.
