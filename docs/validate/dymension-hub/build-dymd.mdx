1. Use `git` to retrieve [Dymension Hub](https://github.com/dymensionxyz/dymension):

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/dymensionxyz/dymension.git --branch v1.0.2-beta
    cd dymension
    ```

2. Build the Dymension Hub. This will install the `dymd` executable to your [ `GOPATH` ](https://go.dev/doc/gopath_code) environment variable.

    ```bash
    make install
    ```

3. Verify that the Dymension Hub full node is installed correctly.

    ```bash
    dymd version --long
    ```

    **Example**:

    ```bash
    name: dymension
    server_name: dymd
    version: v1.0.2-beta
    commit: 74457e007dc802bd9c0be979baa5d83ab4d3226e
    ```

    If the dymd command is not found an error message is returned, confirm that your [GOPATH](https://go.dev/doc/gopath_code#GOPATH) is correctly configured by running the following command:

    ```
    export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
    ```

    ```

4. Run a script that initializes the Dymension Hub full node:

    ```sh
    bash scripts/setup_local.sh
    ```

5. Run the Dymension Hub full node:

    ```
    dymd start
    ```

Now that we have a Dymension Hub full node running we can return to the Roller <a href="/build/quick-start/roller-quick/initialize">initialization</a>.
