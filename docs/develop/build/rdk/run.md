## Step 3: Starting the RDK environment

In the `Hello` directory, we have a helpful bash script that allows you to instantiate and start your RollApp.

If you followed the [Get Started](/docs/develop/get-started/setup.mdx) tutorial please run the following script from within the `Hello` directory:

```bash
bash init.sh
```

If you would like to run the RDK RollApp with a mock base layer please run the following script from within the `Hello` directory:

```bash
bash simulation-init.sh
```

Once you're ready move on next to building on your RollApp!
