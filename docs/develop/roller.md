Roller is an easy-to-use CLI tool for bootstrapping, building, and deploying an IBC-enabled RollApp. Roller abstracts away many of the complexties of running an inter-chain application-specific blockchain into a few simple commands:

-   Install - Installs Roller CLI
-   Init - Creates configuration files
-   Register - Creates a namespace on the Dymension Hub
-   Run - Runs an IBC-enabled RollApp

With Roller developers are able to deploy a RollApp within minutes.

:::info NOTE:
`Roller` will be coming very soon!
:::

`Roller` is the engine that brings the Dymension RDK to life. With `Roller` we will deploy an IBC RollApp connected to the entire inter-chain!
