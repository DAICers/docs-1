# Deploy the Solidity contract

Now that we have our [contract created](create-contract.md) let's see how to deploy it to the EVM RollApp
and test it.

## Contract deployment

```sh
truffle migrate --network development
```

## Contract testing

```sh
truffle test --network development
```

Assuming everythign went well, you should see the following message after the tests completed successfully:

```sh
Using network 'development'.

Congrats! You have created an EVM RollApp, deployed a contract on top of it and interacted with it.<br/>
