# EVM RollApp

In this tutorial we will demonstrate how to deploy a [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) smart contract using [truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/) on top of an EVM RollApp.
The EVM (Ethereum virtual machine) is a software platform, or “virtual computer,” used by developers to create decentralized applications (DApps), as well as to execute and deploy smart contracts on the Ethereum system.

:::info NOTE:
This tutorial will explore developing with dymint, which is still in Alpha stage. If you run into bugs, please write a Github Issue ticket or let us know in our Discord.
:::

The smart contract we will use for this tutorial is a simple contract implementation of a counter functionallity.

### Let's begin!
