# Build a Checkers RollApp

This tutorial will go over building a dYmension RollApp using dymint, dYmension's drop-in replacement for tendermint. The next sections describe how to create a game of checkers using Ignite CLI and the the Rollup Development Kit (RDK). Each section progressively advances the project.

### In this tutorial, you will:

- Find instructions on how to setup your work environment.
- Work with the Ignite CLI.
- Learn how to run a RollApp and a settlement layer full nodes.
- Begin implementing a RollApp for a checkers game.
- Learn how to interact with the RollApp and the settlement layer.

:::info NOTE:
This tutorial will explore developing with the RDK and dymint, which are still in Alpha stage. If you run into bugs, please write a Github Issue ticket or let us know in our [Discord](http://discord.gg/dymension).
