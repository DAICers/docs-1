# Wasm RollApp

In this tutorial we will demonstrate how to deploy a smart contract in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using the CosmWasm virtual machine. CosmWasm is a smart contracts platform built for the Cosmos ecosystem by making use of WebAssembly (Wasm).

:::info NOTE:
This tutorial will explore developing with dymint, which is still in Alpha stage. If you run into bugs, please write a Github Issue ticket or let us know in our Discord.
:::

You can learn more about CosmWasm [here](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/docs/1.0/).

The smart contract we will use for this tutorial is one provided by the CosmWasm team for Nameservice purchasing.

You can check out the contract [here](https://github.com/InterWasm/cw-contracts/tree/main/contracts/nameservice).

# EVM RollApp

In this tutorial we will demonstrate how to deploy a [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) smart contract using [truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/) on top of an EVM RollApp.
The EVM (Ethereum virtual machine) is a software platform, or “virtual computer,” used by developers to create decentralized applications (DApps), as well as to execute and deploy smart contracts on the Ethereum system.

:::info NOTE:
This tutorial will explore developing with dymint, which is still in Alpha stage. If you run into bugs, please write a Github Issue ticket or let us know in our Discord.
:::

The smart contract we will use for this tutorial is a simple contract implementation of a counter functionallity.
