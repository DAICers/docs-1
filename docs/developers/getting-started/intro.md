# Introduction

Turn your smart contract into a blockchain. With Dymension's RollApp Development Kit (RDK), you can deploy a smart contract but with the benefits of having your own blockchain. It is your token of choice for the network fee, it is your choice of block speed (and p.s. you can go very low!), it is your own _autonomy_.

RollApps enable developers to build blockchains as easy as building a smart contract. Dymension's RDK provides default modules (e.g. governance, minting, and distribution) but developers have full control over customizable application logic. If you would like to add or change the provided RDK modules, we welcome and look forward to the ingenuity of RollApp developers!

The RollApp Development Kit (RDK) is built on top of the amazing [Cosmos-SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/main). We recommend reviewing the implementations and what is possible, it's probably more than you expect!

# Build a RollApp

The following tutorials will go over building various flavors of RollApps using the RollApp Development Kit (RDK) and Dymint. Dymension's RDK, similar to the Cosmos SDK, is agnostic to virtual machines built on top of it. Developers may use CosmWasm, Ethermint or any other supported smart contract platform in the Cosmos ecosystem.

:::info NOTE:
The tutorials will explore developing with the [RDK](https://github.com/dymensionxyz/rdk) and [Dymint](https://github.com/dymensionxyz/dymint), which are still in Alpha stage. If you run into bugs, please write a Github Issue ticket or let us know in our [Discord](http://discord.gg/dymension).
:::

The developers section contains tutorials which demonstrate running various virtual machines (CosmWasm and EVM) on top of a RollApp. The next sections of this tutorial will describe how to prepare your work environment and run a Dymension Hub node.
