# Introduction

Turn your smart contract into a blockchain with Dymension's RollApp Development Kit (RDK). Dymension provides the tools for seamlessly deploying a blockchain.

-   Network fees: Charge users fees in your own token or even other tokens (e.g. stablcoins)
-   Virtual Machine: Use existing frameworks to speed up the deployment
-   Customizability: Customize the application logic as you see fit

RollApps enable developers to build blockchains as easy as building a smart contract. Dymension's RDK provides default modules (e.g. governance, minting, and distribution) but developers have full control over application logic. If you would like to add or change the provided RDK modules, we welcome and look forward to the ingenuity of the developer!

The RollApp Development Kit (RDK) is built on top of the amazing [Cosmos-SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/main). We recommend reviewing the implementations and what is possible, it's probably more than you expect!

# Build a RollApp

The following tutorials will go over building various flavors of RollApps using the RollApp Development Kit (RDK). Dymension's RDK, similar to the Cosmos SDK, is agnostic to virtual machines built on top of it. Developers may use CosmWasm, Ethermint or any other supported smart contract platform in the Cosmos ecosystem.

:::info NOTE:
The tutorials will explore developing with the [RDK](https://github.com/dymensionxyz/rdk) and [Dymint](https://github.com/dymensionxyz/dymint), which are still in Alpha stage. If you run into bugs, please write a Github Issue ticket or let us know in our [Discord](http://discord.gg/dymension).

The next section of this tutorial will describe how to prepare your work environment and run a Dymension Hub node.
