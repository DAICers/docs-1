RollApps are composed out of two core services, client and server. The server is the application side designated for the RollApp deployer to implement custom business logic alongside the pre-packaged modules that construct the RollApp Development Kit [(RDK)](https://github.com/dymensionxyz/dymension-rdk). The client component, referred to as [dymint](https://github.com/dymensionxyz/dymint), is a drop-in replacement for Tendermint and responsible for block production, peer message propagation and inter-layer communication.
