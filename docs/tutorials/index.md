# Build a Checkers RollApp

The next sections are all about creating a decentralized game of checkers using Ignite CLI and the dYmension RDK. Each section progressively advances the project. To learn the most efficiently, you should treat each section as _a solution_ to the questions raised at the start of the section.

These exercises help you prepare a conceptual framework for the information that follows. You are not tested on them, but it is in your best interest to complete each one before moving on to the associated section.

## In this tutorial, you will:

- Find instructions on how to setup your work environment.
- Learn how to run a node and interact with a Cosmos SDK chain.
- Work with the Ignite CLI.
- Begin implementing a RollApp for a checkers game using the Ignite CLI.

## Next up

Before you [deploy a RollApp](./deploy-rollapp.md) and explore [Ignite CLI](./ignitecli.md), prep everything for the running exercise - creating a checkers blockchain - by going through the section _[Setup Your Work Environment](./setup.md)_.
