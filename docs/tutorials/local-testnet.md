TODO - Docker

If you want to focus on RollApp development without running any extra dYmension hub nodes, we present you a Docker of the dYmension protocol. This tool comes pre-built with the base layers and your job will be to build the Checkers RollApp without running any nodes. After the Docker is up and running you can continue [here to build your first module.](./build-a-module.md)
