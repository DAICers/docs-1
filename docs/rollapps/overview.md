# RollApps

An application deployed to dYmension’s ecosystem is called a RollApp. RollApps have their own autonomy, meaning they have minimal interactions with low level blockchain logic namely a significant reduction in handling networking and consensus requirements. Autonomous RollApps still retain the benefits of building their own blockchain such as having their own native network fee token, flexible application logic and trust-minimized inter-operability with other RollApps and IBC-enabled blockchains.

RollApp users only interact with the RollApps themselves and all user/network fees are paid according to the RollApp’s application logic. RollApp autonomy enables network fees to be paid in whatever tokens the developer wishes and can be any external token such as stable coins, DYM tokens, the RollApp’s native token or any other. Additionaly, this token can be used like an IBC token and messaged across IBC-enabled blockchains.
