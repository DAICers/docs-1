# State Sync
Dymension rollapp can perform a state sync from a snapshot as long as:
1. The rollapp is using an actual DA layer (Celestia/Avail, no local).

2. The snapshot has been taken less than 30 days ago.

3. The rollapp hasn't changed DA layer since the snapshot was taken.

The procedure is straightforward: Create a compressed archive of the rollapp data directory to create a snapshot, and
load it into the rollapp data to perform the state sync.

## Create a snapshot
1. Stop the rollapp.

2. Install lz4 compression tool if not already installed:
```bash
sudo apt install lz4
```

3. Create a compressed archive of the rollapp data directory:
```bash
    cd <ROLLER_CONFIG_DIR>/rollapp
    tar -cvf - data | lz4 > snapshot.tar.lz4
```

## Load a snapshot
