# State Sync
Dymension rollapps can perform a state sync from a snapshot as long as:
1. The rollapp is using a genuine DA layer (Celestia/Avail) and not a local one.

2. The snapshot has been taken less than 30 days ago.

3. The rollapp hasn't switched DA layer since the snapshot was taken.

## Create a snapshot
Create a compressed archive of the rollapp data directory:
1. Stop the rollapp.

2. Install lz4 compression tool if not already installed:
```bash
sudo apt install lz4
```

3. Create a compressed archive of the rollapp data directory:
```bash
    cd <ROLLER_CONFIG_DIR>/rollapp
    tar -cvf - data | lz4 > snapshot.tar.lz4
```
Replace `<ROLLER_CONFIG_DIR>` with the actual path to the roller config directory (defaults to `~/.roller`).

## Load a snapshot
Load the snapshot from the previous step into the rollapp data directory to perform the sync:
1. Clear the rollapp state with:
```bash
    rollapp_evm dymint unsafe-reset-all --home <ROLLER_CONFIG_DIR>/rollapp
```

2. Load the snapshot into the rollapp data directory:
```bash
    cd <ROLLER_CONFIG_DIR>/rollapp
    lz4 -c -d <SNAPSHOT_FILE_PATH> | tar -x -C .
```

3. Start the Rollapp <br/>
* Ensure the rollapp isn't producing blocks until it's synced. Set `aggregator=false` in the rollapp's config file located
at `<ROLLER_CONFIG_DIR>/rollapp/config/dymint.toml`.
* Start the rollapp using roller run. If you're the sequencer, once the rollapp is synced, set `aggregator=true` and
restart the rollapp.
* Verify the rollapp is fully synced by checking its logs at `<ROLLER_CONFIG_DIR>/rollapp/rollapp.log`. Ensure the current
height matches the sync target in lines resembling:
```bash
level=info msg="Syncing until target[current height 1334 syncTarget 1436]" module=BlockManager
```
:::info NOTE:
Sync may take a few hours when using a Celestia DA layer.
