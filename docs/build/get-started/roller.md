Roller is an easy-to-use CLI tool for bootstrapping, building, and deploying an IBC-enabled RollApp. Roller abstracts away many of the complexties of running an inter-chain application-specific blockchain into a few simple commands:

-   [Install](../deploy/install)
-   [Init](../deploy/initialize)
-   [Register](../deploy/register)
-   [Run](../deploy/run)

With Roller developers are able to deploy a RollApp within minutes.

:::info NOTE:
`Roller Run` abstracts components of deploying a RollApp (i.e. DA light clients, Sequencer full nodes, and relayer nodes) for an in-depth guide including the stand-alone deployment of each process please visit the [advanced guide](../deploy/install-adv.md).

`Roller` is the engine that brings the Dymension RDK to life. With `Roller` we will deploy an IBC RollApp connected to the entire inter-chain!

Let's continue by setting up the required tools!
