Roller is an easy-to-use CLI tool for bootstrapping, building, and deploying an IBC-enabled RollApp. Roller abstracts away many of the complexties of running an inter-chain application-specific blockchain into a few simple commands:

-   [Install](/docs/build/quick-start/roller-quick/install.md)
-   [Init](/docs/build/quick-start/roller-quick/initialize.mdx)
-   [Register](/docs/build/quick-start/roller-quick/register.md)
-   [Run](/docs/build/quick-start/roller-quick/run.md)

With `Roller` developers are able to deploy a RollApp within minutes.

:::info NOTE:
`Roller Run` abstracts components of deploying a RollApp (i.e. DA light clients, Sequencer full nodes, and relayer nodes) for an in-depth guide including the stand-alone deployment of each process please visit the [advanced guide](/docs/build/adv-guide/roller-adv/install-adv.md).

`Roller` is the engine that brings the Dymension RDK to life. With `Roller` we will deploy a RollApp connected to the entire inter-chain!
