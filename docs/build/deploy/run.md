Now that we've registered the RollApp on the Dymension Hub, we can proceed to start running a RollApp with an [IBC bridge](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/academy/3-ibc/) !

:::info NOTE:
The following command abstracts some of the components required for running an IBC-enabled RollApp. For advanced users or for those interested in learning about the different components of an active RollApp please proceed to the [advanced guide](da-light-client) .
:::

To start the RollApp run the following command:

```
roller run
```
