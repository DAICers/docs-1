### Roller installation

Open a terminal and input the following command to install `Roller`:

```
curl -L https://github.com/dymensionxyz/roller/releases/download/v0.0.0/install.sh | bash
```

### Verify Roller version

After installing the `Roller CLI` tool in the [Get started](../get-started/roller) section, we will verify that the version we've installed is the latest stable version:

```
roller version
```

Should return:

```
ðŸ’ˆ Roller version <version>
ðŸ’ˆ Build time: <build-time>
ðŸ’ˆ Git commit: <build-commit>
```

With `Roller` now installed we'll proceed in initializing the RollApp...
