### Installation

Firstly, if you have not installed `Roller` please do so now:

```
curl -L https://github.com/dymensionxyz/roller/releases/download/v0.0.0/install.sh | bash
```

### Initialization

`````mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

````mdx-code-block

We will begin by initializing the configuration files of the RollApp. This will include important components such as the RollApp ID, the name of the currency, and location where the RollApp data will be published to.

<Tabs groupId="shell">
<TabItem value="bash" label="EVM">

```bash
roller config init <NAME>_9000_1 <denom>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="zsh" label="Go">

```zsh
roller config init <NAME>_9000_1 <denom>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
`````

Should return:

```
ðŸ’ˆ RollApp 'name' configuration files have been
   successfully generated on your local machine. Congratulations!

ðŸ”‘ Addresses:

  Celestia         | celestia<ADDRESS>
  Sequencer        | dym<ADDRESS>
  Relayer, Hub     | dym<ADDRESS>
  Relayer, RollApp | ethm<ADDRESS>

ðŸ”” Please fund these addresses to register and run the rollapp.
```

The following addresses must be funded prior to the following steps in this tutorial. Please fund the addresses at the following locations:

-   Celestia: Celestia discord channel for the Mocha network
-   Sequencer: Dymension discord channel for the Froopyland network
-   Relayer, Hub: Dymension discord channel for the Froopyland network
-   Relayer, RollApp: Requires the following command to transfer tokens from the initialized Sequencer address to the Relayer:

```
rollapp_evm tx bank send rollapp_sequencer <relayer-rollapp-address> 3500000<denom> --keyring-backend test --keyring-dir ~/.roller/rollapp --chain-id <rollapp-id> --broadcast-mode block
```

Now that we've funded the wallets we can go ahead and register the RollApp!
