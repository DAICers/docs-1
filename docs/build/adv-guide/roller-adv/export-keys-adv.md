In the [init](./initialize-adv.md) section we allocated the token supply to the RollApp deployer. However, you may want to distribute these tokens to users or friends!

Private keys are the password to your blockchain account. Private keys are a long string of unqiue characters used to sign transactions.

### Export keys

Run the following command to export the Sequencer's private keys:

```
// TODO
roller export-keys
```

Should return:

```
// TODO
