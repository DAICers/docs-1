This advanced tutorial of building and deploy a IBC-connected RollApp includes the deployment of seperate processes for [DA light client](./da-light-client.md), [Sequencer full node](./sequencer.md), and a [IBC relayer](./relayer.md). Please visit the [quick start](../../quick-start/roller-quick/install.md) for a simplified tutorial on how to deploy an EVM RollApp.

### Roller installation

Open a terminal and input the following command to install `Roller`:

```
curl -L https://roller.dymension.xyz/install | bash
```

### Verify Roller version

After installing the `Roller` CLI tool we will verify that the version we've installed is the latest stable version:

```
roller version
```

Should output:

```
ðŸ’ˆ Roller version v0.0.0-38-g87c6104
ðŸ’ˆ Build time: 2023-07-02T17:13:46+0200"
ðŸ’ˆ Git commit: 87c6104feba7c3450833dcb27c7cd32ee261ace6
```

With `Roller` now installed we'll proceed to initializing the RollApp.
