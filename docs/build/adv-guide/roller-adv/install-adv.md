This advanced tutorial of building and deploy a IBC-connected RollApp includes the deployment of seperate processes for [DA light client](./da-light-client.md), [Sequencer full node](./sequencer.md), and a [IBC relayer](./relayer.md). Please visit the [quick start](../../quick-start/roller-quick/install.md) for a simplified tutorial on how to deploy an EVM RollApp.

The advanced guide includes the ability to specify the binary path of a custom RollApp. As such, we recommend to begin this tutorial by learning [how to build with the RDK](/docs/build/adv-guide/rdk/setup/rdk-repo.md) and returning here to deploy the RollApp with `Roller`.

### Roller installation

Open a terminal and input the following command to install `Roller`:

```
curl -L https://dymensionxyz.github.io/roller/install.sh | bash
```

### Verify Roller version

After installing the `Roller` CLI tool we will verify that the version we've installed is the latest stable version:

```
roller version
```

Should output:

```
ðŸ’ˆ Roller version v0.1.3
ðŸ’ˆ Build time: 2023-07-16T14:50:54+0000"
ðŸ’ˆ Git commit: 56ac9b7f22ce6f54d7f81bd88dfe69028d58a0bf
```

With `Roller` now installed we'll proceed to initializing the RollApp.
