title: Building the App
slug: app-config

Now that we've built the module we will need to integrate it into `app.go`. This is usually referred to as the application's main file or main entry point. This is the file that defines what your application does, what transactions it can process, and other related information. In short, it describes your blockchain's application logic.

In the root of the application there is an `app` folder with two files that we will use `app_config.go` and `app.go`. Firstly, we'll need to import the necessary components from the `payment` module into `app_config.go`. The `app_config.go` file is the single place to configure all modules parameters.
