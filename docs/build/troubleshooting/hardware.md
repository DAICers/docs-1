Running a RollApp requires a few processes that may consume hardware resources on the developer's machine. These processes include running a RollApp Sequencer full node, a DA light client, and an IBC relayer.

### Recommended hardware

-   Dual Core
-   At least 500GB of SSD disk storage
-   At least 16GB of memory (RAM)
-   At least 100mbps network bandwidth

These requirements will continually be revisted and tested by the core team and community.

Developers should make sure their resources are according to the stated requirements and enough disk space is dedicated to running the related processes.
