# A Guide for Ethereum Developers

This tutorial is intended for Ethereum developers who have experience with the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/). If you have difficulty with working with Remix IDE please visit the [documentation](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for assistance. It details the steps required to deploy a basic Non-Fungible Token (NFT) smart contract to a local instance of the Remix IDE.

Goals
By the end of this guide, developers should be able to:

-   Understand the procedure for deploying an NFT smart contract
-   Gain proficiency in deploying the smart contract to the EVM

In the Launch section we will deploy the smart contract to a live RollApp and test further functionalities. Follow along to get started with Ethereum development!
