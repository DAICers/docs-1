We will now run a Sequencer node. Sequencers operate like block proposer in a Proof-of-stake blockchain. Sequencers process data off-chain and publish transaction data and state updates on-chain so any peer can reconstruct the state.

```
roller sequencer start
```

Should return:

```
ðŸ’ˆ The Rollapp sequencer is running on your local machine!
ðŸ’ˆ EVM RPC: http://0.0.0.0:8545
ðŸ’ˆ Node RPC: http://0.0.0.0:26657
ðŸ’ˆ Rest API: http://0.0.0.0:1317
```

-   **EVM RPC** provides a RPC gateway for publishing EVM smart contracts
-   **Node RPC** provides a RPC gateway for requests to the node
-   **Rest API** provides a REST gateway for requests to the node
