Registering the RollApp adds a namespace in the core logic of the Dymension Hub to account for the newly initalized RollApp.

Instead of managing a multi-sig smart contract, a developer only needs to register the RollApp with a simple command. This will allow a Sequencer to publish state updates on-chain and furthermore facilitate the bridging between ecosystems.

```
roller register
```

Should return:

```
ðŸ’ˆ Rollapp '<rollapp-id>' has been successfully registered on the hub.
```

Now that we've successfully registered the RollApp to the Dymension Hub let's proceed and run the necessary processes.
