Now that we've registered the EVM RollApp on the Dymension Hub, we can proceed to start running the RollApp with an [IBC bridge](/docs/learn/rollapps/bridging.md).

IBC allows users to easily and securely bridge to the entire IBC ecosystem via the Dymension Hub!

:::info NOTE:
The following command abstracts some of the components required for running an IBC-enabled RollApp. For advanced users or for those interested in learning about the different components of an active RollApp please proceed to the [advanced guide](/docs/build/adv-guide/roller-adv/da-light-client.md) .
:::

To start the EVM RollApp run the following command:

```
roller run
```

// TODO - What is the user expected to see?
