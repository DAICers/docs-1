In the [init](./initialize.md) section we allocated the token supply to the RollApp deployer. However, you may want to distribute these tokens to users or friends!

Private keys are a long string of characters used to sign transactions. We will export the Sequencer's private keys so we can easily transfer with metamask.

### Export keys

Run the following command to export the Sequencer's private keys:

```
// TODO
roller export-keys
```

Should return:

```
// TODO
```

### Next steps

That's it! We've successfully built and ran an IBC-enabled RollApp.
