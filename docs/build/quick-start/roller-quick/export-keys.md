In the [init](./initialize) section we allocated the token supply to the RollApp deployer. However, you may want to distribute these tokens to users or friends! We will do so by exporting the Sequencer's private keys so we can easily transfer with metamask.

Private keys are the password to your blockchain account. Private keys are a long string of unqiue characters used to sign transactions.

### List keys

Run the following command to export the Sequencer's private keys:

```
roller keys list
```

Should return as an example:

```
ðŸ”‘ Addresses:

  my_celes_key        | RollApp Sequencer account on Celestia
  hub_sequencer       | RollApp Sequencer account on the Dymension Hub
  rollapp_sequencer   | RollApp Sequencer account on the RollApp
  relayer-hub-key     | IBC relayer account on Dymension Hub
  relayer-rollapp-key | IBC relayer account on RollApp
```

### Export keys

Run the following command to export the Sequencer's private keys (currently only supporting `hub_sequencer` and `rollapp_sequencer`):

```
roller keys export rollapp_sequencer
```

### Next steps

Let's connect and import them into a Metamask wallet...
