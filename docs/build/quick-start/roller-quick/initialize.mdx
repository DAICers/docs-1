### Initialization

Initializing the configuration files of the RollApp will create the necessary information to start a new RollApp. This will create a folder `~/.roller` in the root directory of your computer with important files such as the `Genesis` file.

`````mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

````mdx-code-block

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="Guide" label="Guide">

// TODO how does it start?

An interactive guide will ask the following questions:

1. What is the RollApp name?
    <br />
    (i.e. ROLLAPP_9000_1 please note the suffix of `_9000_1` is required for EVM
    RollApps)
2. What is the name of the RollApp currency?
    <br />
    (i.e. aphoton, udym)
3. What is the amount of tokens to be minted on Genesis?
    <br />
    (i.e. 1000000)
4. What is the location data will be published to?
    <br />
    (i.e. Celestia, Avail)
5. What is the application environment?
    <br />
    (i.e. EVM, Go modules)

    -   EIP155: is a 1 to 5 digit number representing the EIP155 rollapp ID

### Address funding

After initializing the RollApp, addresses to fund should be returned to you:

```
ðŸ”‘ Addresses:

Sequencer | Address used to publish state updates to the Dymension Hub
Relayer   | Address that handles the relaying of IBC packets
Celestia  | Address used to publish data on-chain to the DA network
```

In Dymension's [discord](https://discord.gg/dymension) please fund the addresses in the `froopyland-faucet` channel with the following command as an example:

```
$REQUEST dym15ad5y52e3zx784hl0b4uyw5huctktwty2dq2vn // TODO add chain-id
$REQUEST dym1j968h4avztqmgeh3bn4p2tfh4ptxp055e056sy
$REQUEST celestia1wnqasu0vze3qn8jldv9hx4yhf5w59l080u5mg0
```

You can then check the balance of the address with:

```
$BALANCE dym15ad5y52e3zx784hl0b4uyw5huctktwty2dq2vn
```

Now that we've funded the wallets we can go ahead and register the RollApp!
