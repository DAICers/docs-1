Now that we have an active IBC-enabled RollApp, let's transfer tokens using an IBC transaction from your RollApp to the Dymension Hub faucet address at `dym1g8sf7w4cz5gtupa6y62h3q6a4gjv37pgefnpt5`.

Using this faucet, users will be able to request tokens to play around with your RollApp.

:::info NOTE:
When making a faucet request, you will receive 500 \* 10^{decimal-points} base tokens.
To ensure a smooth token distribution process for your network, it is crucial to provide the faucet with an adequate amount of tokens (in multiples of 500).
:::

### Fund faucet

Input the following command to fund the Dymension Hub faucet with your RollApp token on `froopyland` testnet:

```
roller tx fund-faucet
```

:::info Note:
It may take up to 15-30 minutes until your balance is available in the faucet
:::

Run the following command to check the balance of your RollApp token on the Dymension Hub's froopyland faucet [discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/956961633165529098/1143231362468434022):

```
$balances dym1g8sf7w4cz5gtupa6y62h3q6a4gjv37pgefnpt5 <rollapp-id>
```

Users will be able to request tokens with the following command:

```
$request <user-address> <rollapp-id>
```

It is then recommended to utilize the [Portal](https://portal.dymension.xyz/) for IBC transfers to the respective RollApp.

### Transfer IBC Tokens

To initiate an IBC transfer let's first find the source channel for our RollApp:

```bash
roller relayer status
```

The output should look similar to the following:

```bash
ðŸ’ˆ Relayer Channels: src, channel-0 <-> channel-1, dst
```

The source channel, in this case `channel-0`, will be used in the following command and will be referred to as `<src-channel>`.

Next, let's make the actual transfer:

:::warning NOTE:
if the following command, if you've set your denom to be e.g `XYZ`, the value of the `<base-denom>` should be `uXYZ` where the value after the `u` is case sensitive.

:::info Note:
The large amount of `0`s for the RollApp denom are due to the fact that the `base denom` is defined as 10^18 for the `denom` as noted in the [initialization](/docs/build/quick-start/roller-quick/initialize.mdx) section.
This is similar to how Ethereum uses `wei` as the base unit and `ether` as the main unit.

Next lets go over on how to export your keys.
