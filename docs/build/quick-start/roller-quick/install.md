In this `Quick start` tutorial we will be deploying an EVM RollApp with `Roller`. Please visit the [advanced guide](/docs/build/adv-guide/roller-adv/install-adv.md) for instructions on how to build a RDK RollApp with a breakdown of each component of `Roller`.

### Roller installation

Open a terminal and input the following command to install `Roller`:

```
curl -L https://roller.dymension.xyz/install | bash
```

### Verify Roller version

After installing the `Roller` CLI tool we will verify that the version we've installed is the latest stable version:

```
roller version
```

Should output:

```
ðŸ’ˆ Roller version v0.0.0-38-g87c6104
ðŸ’ˆ Build time: 2023-07-02T17:13:46+0200"
ðŸ’ˆ Git commit: 87c6104feba7c3450833dcb27c7cd32ee261ace6
```

With `Roller` now installed we'll proceed to initializing the RollApp.
