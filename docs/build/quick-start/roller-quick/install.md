In this tutorial we will be deploying a RollApp with `Roller`.

### Roller installation

Open a terminal and input the following command to install `Roller`:

```
curl -L https://dymensionxyz.github.io/roller/install.sh | bash
```

### Verify Roller version

After installing the `Roller` CLI tool we will verify that the version we've installed is the latest stable version:

```
roller version
```

Should output:

```
ðŸ’ˆ Roller version v0.1.4
ðŸ’ˆ Build time: 2023-07-31T13:46:48+0000"
ðŸ’ˆ Git commit: 478fa2d63a311b9d9956f1b81d64cfbbb09e9d25
```

With `Roller` now installed we'll proceed to initializing the RollApp.
