:::info Welcome to the dYmension documentation

dYmension's documentation serves as the central source for all things dYmension. Learn, build and grow the dYmension ecosystem.

The documentation is broken down into:

- Learn: Learn about foundational topics related to dYmension
- Developers: Build applications within the dYmension ecosystem
- Node Runners: Run a dYmension hub node

### What is dYmension?

dYmension is a multi-layer protocol built for servicing high performant blockchains called [RollApps](/learn/rollapps.md) (aka app-specfic-rollups/modular execution environments). 

dYmension allows anyone to build and deploy their own blockchain, a RollApp instance on top of dYmensionâ€™s settlement layer. 

The dYmension settlement layer, also referred to as the dYmension Hub, is the protocol base layer, a Proof of Stake neutral blockchain which provides conseunes, security and liquidity for RollApps.   

RollApps are built with dYmension's RollApp Development Kit (RDK) which is based on top of the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/) (benefits from Cosmos compatiblity). RollApp Developers are able to choose the token, fee-structure, logic and VM (i.e. EVM, WASM) in which their RollApp will operate.

To learn more in depth read the [Litepaper](/dymension-litepaper/dymension-litepaper-index) and [glossary](/reference/glossary) concepts.


### Why dYmension?

dYmension is a permissionless network of RollApps. Deploying a RollApp means easily plugging into 2-order network effects, as RollApps enjoy seamless connectivity not only with each other but also with the entire [IBC-enabled ecosystem](https://mapofzones.com/) (Cosmos) via the dYmension hub. 

With dYmension, building a blockchain doesn't come with the overhead of bootstraping a network, additionally RollApps are autonomous, meaning RollApps set their own economic and decentralization parameters for transaction sequencers.

By using an *Optimistic Rollup* design - RollApps are capable of delivering higher throughput and lower latency compared to dApps on Ethereum or Cosmos SDK blockchains. Developers can easily play around and build new use cases with on top of their own chains, all while remaining true to the decentralized, permission-less and trust-minimized attributes of the blockchain ethos. 

Today, you can [build **your own RollApp**](/docs/tutorials/rollapp/index.md) and deploy (or motivate others) [smart contracts **on a RollApp!**](/docs/tutorials/smart-contract/index.md) We encourage all members of the community to reach out to us, show the community what they are building and build the future of blockchain!
