# Development Portal

This documentation is designed to help you build and interact with dYmension. It cover dYmension as a concept, explains the dYmension tech stack and documents procedures for deploying an application to dYmension.

This is an open-source community effort, so feel free to suggest new topics by creating an issue in the [GitHub](https://github.com/dymensionxyz/docs/issues), add new content and provide examples wherever you think might be helpful. All documentation can be edited via GitHub.

## A Hitchhiker's Guide to dYmension

### Overview

dYmension introduces robust infrastructure and tools for building application-specific rollups on top of a specialized settlement layer. dYmension is akin to a hub and factory for such applications. dYmension applications scale with the segregation of resource consumption while plugging into an inter-connected, decentralized and trust-minimized environment. dYmension is infrastructure that glues traditional and reliable web2-like instances with the ownership and connectivity advantages of the decentralized internet.

dYmension follows a modular blockchain architecture design that decouples different functions of a ‘Monolithic’ blockchain for greater performance and scalability. In dYmension each application is its own execution environment and the dYmension hub is the settlement layer. Various data availability providers will co-exist in a modular future; thus, dYmension is designed to be data availability agnostic, enabling RollApps to easily choose their data availability provider.
