:::info Welcome to the dYmension documentation

dYmension's documentation serves as the central source for all things dYmension. Learn, build and grow the dYmension ecosystem.

The documentation is broken down into:

- Concepts: Learn about foundational blockchain topics related to dYmension
- Developer Tutorials: Build applications within the dYmension ecosystem
- Node Runners: Run a dYmension node

### What is dYmension?

dYmension is a multi-layered blockchain protocol which provides tooling for building and deploying permission-less application-specific rollups on top of an optimized settlement layer.

Developers receive a highly scalable execution environment and plug themselves into the dYmension and wider [IBC-enabled ecosystem](https://mapofzones.com/). dYmension enables scalability by seperating execution from settlement. Application-specific rollups, referred to as RollApps, is how the dYmension protocol scales in a secure, trust-minimized way.

Each [RollApp](/docs/concepts/rollapps.md) is built using the dYmension RollApp Development Kit (RDK), which is an abstraction of the Cosmos SDK. The flexability of the dYmension settlement layer allows RollApps to be run in a multitude array of virtual machines (evenutally including EVM and others).

dYmension implements a shared security model that strengthens as more applications are deployed. Unlike other shared security protocols such as Polkadot, dYmension provides permission-less access to deploy a RollApp.

### What is the DYM token?

DYM token is required to facilitate the following:

- AMM RollApp token swaps
- IRC and IBC transactions
- State root updates
- Growing staking requirements for RollApp Sequencers

Unlike smart contracts applications in general purpose blockchains, RollApps on dYmension receive their own autonomy. This allows RollApps to have their own native protocol network fee and charge network fees (gas) according to their own custom application logic. Instead of charging end-users of RollApps DYM token as a fee, all fees are charged in the RollApp instance network token (or any other token according to the application logic). This seperation of concerns allows RollApps to build their own sustainable products, while dYmension benefits from the network effects of a growing RollApp ecosystem.

More information regarding tokenomics, airdrops, grants and more will be released to the community in a timely manner. For the latest information or to speak with a core team member of the dYmension protocol reach out to us on [discord](http://discord.gg/mvnh3YVa2W).
