### What is dYmension?

dYmension is a multi-layered blockchain protocol which provides tooling for building and deploying permission-less application-specific rollups on top of an optimized settlement layer.

Developers receive an highly scalable execution environment and plug themselves into the dYmension and wider [IBC-enabled](https://mapofzones.com/) ecosystem. dYmension enables scalability by seperating execution from settlement. Mo

Application-specific rollups, referred to as RollApps, is how the dYmension protocol scales in a secure, trust-minimized way.

Each RollApp is built using the dYmension RollApp Development Kit (RDK), which is an abstraction of the Cosmos SDK. The flexability of the dYmension settlement layer allows RollApps to be run in a multitude array of virtual machines (evenutally including EVM and others).
